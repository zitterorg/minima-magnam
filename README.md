# Installation
```
npm install @zitterorg/minima-magnam
```

# Usage
**Note:** An update has been planned to remove the need to explicitly declare if the file is CRLF or LF break files!

```js
const @zitterorg/minima-magnam = require('@zitterorg/minima-magnam');
```

`New()` is the main class, create a new instance of this!
The instance of @zitterorg/minima-magnam has three main functions, two of them registering variables and functions, the third being the executer.

`RegisterVariable` - Takes in two strings, the first is the replacer(or tag) and the second is the "to be replaced".
`RegisterFunction` - Takes in a string and a function, the first one being the tag, the second one being the function that can be executed.

`Execute` - Takes a string and writer(a function/method), the string template is parsed. Any regular strings that are not variable/function tags will be executed by the writer. Variable tags will be replaced and functions will be executed with respect to the parameters that were provided in the string template.

## Examples:
```js
const @zitterorg/minima-magnam = require('@zitterorg/minima-magnam');
var registry = new @zitterorg/minima-magnam.New();

registry.RegisterVariable("foo", "bar");
registry.RegisterFunction("sleep",
  function(delayInms){
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayInms));
  }
);

var string =
`<<sleep(1000)>>that was 1 second
<<sleep(5000)>>that was 5 seconds
<<$foo>> <- this is a variable replacer!`;
```

## Carriage Return Line Feed Files
Also known as CRLF, this is what most files @zitterorg/minima-magnam is supposedly parsing, files are expected to have `\r\n` at the end of each line. This mode will not add a carriage return `\r` at the end of each line.
```js
const @zitterorg/minima-magnam = require('@zitterorg/minima-magnam');
var registry = new @zitterorg/minima-magnam.New();
```
## Line feed
Also known as LF, these type of files **do not** have a carriage return character at the end of each line(`\r`). A `\r` character will be added to the end of every line.  This is used to handle the issue where everything is output in 1 line by the writer.
```js
const @zitterorg/minima-magnam = require('@zitterorg/minima-magnam');
var registry = new @zitterorg/minima-magnam.New(null, true);
```

## Custom splitter
Using a custom splitter that isn't the default `<<`, `>>`.
```js
// custom splitter
const @zitterorg/minima-magnam = require('@zitterorg/minima-magnam');
var registry = new @zitterorg/minima-magnam.New(["[[", "]]"], true);
// E.g. This will now allow you to use [[$tag]] instead of <<$tag>>
```
